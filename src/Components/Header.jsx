          I am ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. I'm here to
          assist and provide information on a wide range of topics. You can ask
          me questions, seek explanations, or request help with various
          subjects. Please note that while I strive to provide accurate and
          helpful information, my responses should be verified and
